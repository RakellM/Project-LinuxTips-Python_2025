# Project Dundie Rewards 🏆

We have been hired by _Dunder Mifflin_, a major paper manufacturer, to develop a reward system for their employees.

Michael, the company's manager, wants to increase employee motivation by offering a points system. Employees can accumulate points based on achieved goals, bonuses offered by the manager, and they can also exchange points with each other.

Once a year, an employee can redeem their points for a credit card to spend anywhere they want.

We agreed in the contract that the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) will be a terminal-based version, with future plans to include UI, web, and API interfaces.

Data for current employees will be provided in a file, which can be in .csv or .json format, and this same file can be used for future versions. `Name`, `Department`, `Position`, `Email`.
